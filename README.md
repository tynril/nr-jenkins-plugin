# New Relic Jenkins Plugin
The New Relic Jenkins Plugin is a Jenkins plugin that provides various
mechanisms for reporting information from your Jenkins server to New Relic.

The following integrations are supported.

1. Application build events (initialized, started, finalized, etc) with various
   build metrics reported as custom attributes are automatically pushed into
   Insights using the Insights Insert API.
1. APM deployment markers can be pushed to New Relic using the
   "Record New Relic Deployment Marker" notifier by adding a post-build step. 
1. Application deployment events that mirror the APM deployment markers can
   be pushed into Insights whenever a deployment marker is sent using the
   "Create Insights Deployment Event" check box on the
   "Record New Relic Deployment Marker" notifier.

### Setup credentials
The [Jenkins Credentials](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin)
plugin is required to store the New Relic API keys used by the New Relic
Jenkins plugin.  To setup the required credentials, perform the following steps.

1. Login to your Jenkins server as an adminstrator
1. Navigate to `/jenkins/credentials/store/system/domain/_/`
1. Locate the section labeled "Upload Plugin"
1. Click on the button labeled "Add Credentials"
1. Ensure that "Username with password" is selected from the "Kind" dropdown
   menu
1. Ensure "Global (...)" is selected from the "Scope" dropdown menu
1. Enter your RPM account ID in the "Username" field
1. Enter your Insights Insert API Key in the "Password" field
1. Enter a value for the "ID" field, e.g. "insights-insert-key"
1. Optionally enter a value for the "Description" field.
1. Click on the button labeled "OK"
1. Navigate to `/jenkins/configure`
1. Scroll down to the section labeled "New Relic"
1. Select the key you just created in the dropdown labeled
   "Insights Insert Credentials"
1. Click on the button labeled "Save"

### Setup proxy
The New Relic Jenkins Plugin supports the use of
[the global Jenkins Proxy Configuration](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JenkinsBehindProxy)
for allowing Jenkins installations behind proxies to send data to New Relic.  To
setup the proxy configuration, perform the following steps.

1. Login to your Jenkins server as an adminstrator
1. Navigate to `/jenkins/pluginManager/advanced`
1. Locate the section labeled "HTTP Proxy Configuration"
1. Enter the host name of your proxy server in the field labeled "Server"
1. Enter the port of your proxy server in the field labeled "Port"
1. If your proxy server requires HTTP Proxy Authentication:
   1. Enter the proxy server username in the "User name" field
   1. Enter the proxy server password in the "Password" field
1. Optionally enter host name patterns for connections that should *not* go
   through the proxy in the field labeled "No Proxy Host", one per line.
1. Click on the button labeled "Submit"

### Setup collection intervals
The New Relic Jenkins Plugin has two customizable collection intervals.
The event harvest interval controls the frequency at which events are harvested
from the event collector and sent to New Relic.  The default is 60 seconds.
The system metric sample interval controls the frequency at which samples are taken
of the Jenkins environment.  The default is 15 seconds.

To customize the collection intervals, perform the following steps.

1. Login to your Jenkins server as an adminstrator
1. Navigate to `/jenkins/configure`
1. Scroll down to the section labeled "New Relic"
1. Optionally enter a new value for the event harvest interval in the field labeled "Event Harvest Interval"
1. Optionally enter a new value for the system metric sample interval in the field labeled "System Metric Sample Interval"  
1. Click on the button labeled "Save"

### Setup global custom attributes
The New Relic Jenkins Plugin can be customized to add custom attributes to all
events produced by a specific Jenkins instance.

To customize global custom attributes, perform the following steps.

1. Login to your Jenkins server as an administrator
1. Navigate to `/jenkins/configure`
1. Scroll down to the section labeled "New Relic"
1. Optionally add any Global Custom Attribute as desired
1. Click on the button labeled "Save"

### Dashboards
Once installed and configured, the New Relic Jenkins Plugin will immediately
start sending build events for all builds in Jenkins to Insights.  Build events
are collected and reported to Insights in 1 minute harvest cycles by default.  Insights
dashboards can use the custom event type `AppBuildEvent` in NRQL queries to
display Jenkins build data.

#### AppBuildEvent
Each application build event is represented by a custom Insights event of type
`AppBuildEvent`.  `AppBuildEvent`s have the following attributes.

| Attribute name | Attribute description | Example value(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| provider | Name of the CI/CD provider | Jenkins |
| providerVersion | Version of the CI/CD provider | 2.140 |

In addition to the attributes above, each job supports sending custom attributes
with the `AppBuildEvent` as well as a switch to disable events for the job from
being reported via the "Customize New Relic build event settings".

#### AppDeploymentEvent
`AppDeploymentEvent`s can be created simultaneously with APM deployment markers
by selecting the "Create Insights Deployment Event" check box on the
"Record New Relic Deployment Marker" notifier when creating a post-build step.
`AppDeploymentEvent`s have the following attributes.

| Attribute name | Attribute description | Example value(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| provider | Name of the CI/CD provider | Jenkins |
| providerVersion | Version of the CI/CD provider | 2.140 |

#### JenkinsSystemEvent
Various attributes about the Jenkins environment are reported as a custom
Insights event of type `JenkinsSystemEvent`.  `JenkinsSystemEvent`s are collected and
reported to Insights in 15 second harvest cycles by default.  `JenkinsSystemEvent`s have
the following attributes.

Note that the the number of items that have left the queue (either via normal termination or being cancelled) is
not a strictly cumulative number.  The number of left items is cleared periodically because not
_all_ items can be kept indefinitely.

#### Example NRQL queries
Below are some sample NRQL queries that can be used to visualize build event
information.

**Build count billboard**
```sql
SELECT uniqueCount(buildId) AS Builds, filter(uniqueCount(buildId), WHERE buildEventType='finalized' AND buildResult ='SUCCESS') AS 'Passed', filter(uniqueCount(buildId), WHERE buildEventType='finalized' AND buildResult != 'SUCCESS')  AS 'Failed' FROM AppBuildEvent SINCE TODAY
```

**Build results timeseries**
```sql
SELECT filter(uniqueCount(buildId), WHERE buildEventType='finalized' AND buildResult ='SUCCESS') AS 'Passed', filter(uniqueCount(buildId), WHERE buildEventType='finalized' AND buildResult != 'SUCCESS')  AS 'Failed' FROM AppBuildEvent TIMESERIES
```

**Build count by job bar chart**
```sql
SELECT uniqueCount(buildId) AS Builds FROM AppBuildEvent FACET jobName
```

**Average build duration timeseries**
```sql
SELECT average(buildDuration), max(buildDuration), min(buildDuration) FROM AppBuildEvent TIMESERIES
```

**Average build duration by job bar chart**
```sql
SELECT average(buildDuration) FROM AppBuildEvent FACET jobName
```

**Average build duration by job timeseries**
```sql
SELECT average(buildDuration) FROM AppBuildEvent FACET jobName TIMESERIES
```

**Today's builds vs yesterday's builds timeseries**
```sql
SELECT uniqueCount(buildId) AS Builds FROM AppBuildEvent SINCE TODAY COMPARE WITH 1 DAY AGO TIMESERIES
```

**Average build delay timeseries**
```sql
SELECT average(buildDelay) FROM AppBuildEvent
```

**Build message event stream**
```sql
SELECT buildMessage FROM AppBuildEvent LIMIT 50
```

## Usage in pipeline
This plugin may be used in a Jenkinsfile, as such:
```
pipeline {
   options {
      newRelic(
         disableAppBuildEvents: false,
         customAttributes: [
            keyValuePair(name: 'customAttributeName', value: 'Custom value.'),
         ]
      )

      // (...)
   }

   // (...)
}
```

Both arguments are optional, with `disableAppBuildEvents` defaulting to `false`,
and `customAttributes` defaulting to an empty list.

## Troubleshooting
To troubleshoot issues, the first steps is creating a new Jenkins logger to
view the New Relic Jenkins logs.  This is accomplished as follows.

1. Login to your Jenkins server as an adminstrator
1. Navigate to `/jenkins/log`
1. Click on the button labeled "Add new log recorder"
1. In the field labeled "Name", enter "New Relic Logger"
1. Click on the button labeled "OK"
1. Click on the button labeled "Add" next to the label "Loggers"
1. In the field labeled "Logger", enter "com.newrelic.experts"
1. Select the value "ALL" from the menu labeled "Log level"
1. Click on the button labeled "Save"

Once this logger has been created, logs can be viewed as follows.

1. Login to your Jenkins server as an adminstrator
1. Navigate to `/jenkins/log`
1. Click on the link labeled "New Relic Logger"
1. This page will refresh every 30s to display detailed logging output for
   the New Relic Jenkins plugin

### Build
[As with most Jenkins plugins](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial/prepare/),
this plugin uses Maven to build.

1. Clone this repository
1. Run `mvn package`

The Jenkins HPI file will be built and placed into the `target` directory, e.g.
